Running a NCID Server

Before you can use NCIDpop, you will need to be running a Network
Caller ID server. NCIDpop is designed for use with ncidd. When NCIDpop
first starts, you will need to enter the hostname or IP address of the
server running ncidd.

If you are running ncidd on a non-default port (i.e., not 3333),
enter the server name followed by a colon and the port number, e.g.,
callerid.domain.name:1234.
