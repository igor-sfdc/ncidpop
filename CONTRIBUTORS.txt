Nicholas Riley:
    Fixed up NCIDpop for Mac OS X so it compiles with Xcode 3.x and on
    Intel.  (The project files in the current ncidpop release are too old
    to even be imported by current versions of Xcode, and an API being used
    was deprecated and not endian-safe.  Added some of the other Windows
    features (history and reverse lookup).  Also cleaned up the popup display
    as it was hard to read in a hurry when someone was calling.  Added new
    features in NCIDpop 0.9.16 and later.

    Fixed problems and added features in the Windows version of NCIDpop
