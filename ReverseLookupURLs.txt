Some possible Reverse Telephone Number Lookup URL's
(all have pop-up/under ads):

http://www.411.com/phone/$AREA-$NPA-$NXX
http://www.yellowpages.com/reversephonelookup?phone=$AREA$NPA$NXX

For international, you can use $ALL to pass the number on directly with no formatting.
Here's an example for an Italian lookup URL:
