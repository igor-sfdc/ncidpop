Mac OS XDownload NCIDpop-MacOSX-0.10.10.dmg (or NCIDpop-MacOSX-Compat-0.10.10.dmg for pre Java 6 systems) to your hard drive. Copy the NCIDpop application to your Applications folder. Double-click to launch it. Depending on your version of Mac OS X, there may be no visual indication, but you can verify that it is running by looking for "NCIDpop" in Activity Monitor. NCIDpop will automatically quit when you log out or shut down your Mac.This installation may require the Java Runtime.  If not installed, you should be prompted to install it on first launch.To launch NCIDpop automatically when you log in to Mac OS X, add it tothe Accounts > Login Items panel in System Preferences.To view your call history, open NCIDpop again (after it is running).Running a NCID ServerBefore you can use NCIDpop, you will need to be running a NetworkCaller ID server. NCIDpop is designed for use with ncidd. When NCIDpopfirst starts, you will need to enter the hostname or IP address of theserver running ncidd. If the server is running on the local computer, enter "localhost".If you are running ncidd on a non-default port (i.e., not 3333),enter the server name followed by a colon and the port number, e.g.,callerid.domain.name:1234.
